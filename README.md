I just completed my first week of diving into Excel, and I'm excited to share the progress I've made. I've been immersing myself in the "Beginner to Pro FREE Excel Data Analysis Course" by Chandoo, and it has truly been an eye-opening experience. Throughout this week, I've explored various techniques that have empowered me to extract valuable insights from data and make well-informed decisions.

In this course, I've gained knowledge in the following areas:
- Approaching a data analysis project
- Working on real-world example data with 10 problems
- Receiving a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire analysis process
- Using techniques for calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, median, quartiles, range, distinct items count, etc.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis directly in Excel
- Utilizing formulas and pivot tables for analysis
- Identifying top/bottom performing items and anomaly detection
- Exploring best-in-class analysis and report preparation
- Merging data from different tables (spreadsheets)
- Learning how to answer open-ended questions using Excel
- Preparing and using Excel charts
- Challenging myself with homework assignments for practical application

In addition to mastering these techniques, I also familiarized myself with important Excel features such as Tables, Formulas, Pivot Tables, Power Pivot measures, Conditional formatting, Charts, Data Validation, and some very useful keyboard shortcuts and tricks.
